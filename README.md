# Pipeline-for-the-analysis-of-association-between-candidate-variants-and-proteomic-biomarkers
This is a part of pipeline codes to determine the association between candidate variants and proteomic biomarkers using a linear regression model after adjustment for covariates

1. run 'generation_of_synthetic_data.R' to get genotype, phenotype, and covariate files
2. run 'main_analysis_file_association_analysis.R' to do the analysis and create forest plot to show the association.
3. There is an example of output image file named 'Rplot_forestplot_example1.png'
